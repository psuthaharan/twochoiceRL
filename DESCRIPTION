Description: Provides functions for (1) simulating a two-choice decision dataset based on the Q-learning model,
    (2) visualizing behavior of a particular simulated individual, and (3) estimating behavior - the learning 
    rate (alpha) and choice randomness (beta) - from the simulated dataset using three parameter estimation 
    techniques: Maximum-Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Maximum A Posteriori (MAP), and Expectation-Maximization 
    with Laplace approximation (EML).
